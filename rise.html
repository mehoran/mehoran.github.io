<p>From <i><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk">Wikipedia</a></b>: "In August 1992, early 1990s California punk rock and pop punk was noticed by the magazine Spin when the magazine published a story called "California Screamin' ", which is about the early 1990s underground punk rock scene in California, mentioning pop punk bands like Screeching Weasel and Green Day. In 1993, California's Green Day and Bad Religion were both signed to major labels, and by 1994, pop punk was quickly growing in mainstream popularity. Many punk rock and pop punk bands originated from the California punk scene of the late 1980s, and several of those bands, especially Green Day and the Offspring, helped revive interest in punk rock in the 1990s."</i></p>
