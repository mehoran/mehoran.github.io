<p>From <i><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk">Wikipedia</a></b>: "Pop punk lost its mainstream popularity in the early 2010s, with rock bands and guitars becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. Some acts, such as New Found Glory, have seen concert attendance numbers decrease steadily. Devon Maloney of MTV wrote that "Pop punk and emo bands don't headline Coachella or Bonnaroo; they rarely, if ever, are even billed on mainstream festival stages," and notes that it has similarly disappeared from the press. The only magazines that feature pop punk bands are niche publications like Alternative Press and the occasional teen magazine, while influential pop punk magazine AMP ceased publication in 2013. The decline in mainstream popularity for the genre, coupled with the closure of many mid-size venues associated with it, has resulted in many venues and labels returning to the DIY ethic that first spawned the punk movement. ... In the early 2010s, a new wave of pop punk groups emerged, fronted by the Wonder Years, State Champs, Neck Deep, Real Friends and Knuckle Puck. Dave Beech of Clash noted that these groups were "[d]arker and more mature" than those previously, taking influence "and occasional indifference" from 1990s emo, music commentator Finn McKenty also cited the influence from hardcore punk as being prominent during this period."</i></p>
