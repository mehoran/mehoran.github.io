<p>From <i><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk">Wikipedia</a></b>: "An article by Kerrang! credited Machine Gun Kelly as well as Yungblud as bringing the genre back to mainstream attention. In addition to this, the publication cited the app TikTok as one of the key factors, as videos tagged #poppunk had received 400 million views by January 21st 2021. On the app, viral trends took place using tracks from pop punk bands like All Time Low, Simple Plan and Paramore. Some popular TikTok content creators even began releasing music in the genre around this time. ... During this period a number of other mainstream acts began experimenting with the genre such as Olivia Rodrigo, Maggie Lindemann, Trippie Redd, Tyler Posey, Chloe Moriondo and Willow Smith."</i></p>
