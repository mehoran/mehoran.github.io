<p>From <i><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk">Wikipedia</a></b>: "[Jason] Heller said that the Ramones crafted a blueprint for pop-punk with their 1976 debut album, but 1978 was the year that the genre "came into its own". He noted that some bands "were unmistakably pop-punk bands by today's definition of the term, but in 1978, the distinction wasn't so clear. Plenty of punk groups of the era threw a token pop tune or two into their setâ€”sometimes for ironic effect, other times earnestly." Heller also acknowledged that many "burgeoning pop-punk groups in 1978 bordered on power-pop, a parallel genre on the rise at the time. But power-pop began earlier, and it was a more American phenomenon"."</i></p>
